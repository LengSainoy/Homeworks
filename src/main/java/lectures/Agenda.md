## Access Modifier
## `static` keyword

## Encapsulation
 
## Inheritance
  - child class derived methods and field(properties) from the parent class
  - subclass can extends or implement superclass
  - therefore, child-class/subclass know everything that parent/super class has (have access to 
    fields and methods, as long as that member doesn't have `private` access modifier)

  - Show Animal class (name, age, size) [eat(), move()]
  - then Goose class extends Animal (leg, color) [fly(), swim()]
  - try to call eat() and move() from a child class

  - add parameterize constructor in super class
  - call parent constructor with super() in child class

### extends
### super keyword
    
### Object inheritance
The Object class is the base class of all other's classes
- create an empty class then do . operator
  - toString()
  - equals()
  
## Polymorphism 
Overriding vs Overloading

## Enumeration ?
