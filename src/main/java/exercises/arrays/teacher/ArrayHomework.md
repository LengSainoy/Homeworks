# Array Homeworks

1. create an array that has the numbers 100 to 1
2. Write a program that can count the even and odd number from an array of integers _Note: MUST use
   for each loop_
```text
input: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
output:
evenNumberCount = 3,
OddNumberCount = 4
```
3. write a program that can count how many palindromes in an array of string

```text
input:
{"anna", "level", "Java"}; 

output:
2
```

4. create string array, and store the names of your class mates (10) reverse each students names and print them in 
   separate lines

```text
input:
arr = {java, python, c#}

output:
avaJ
nohtyp
#c
```

5. Given the following arrays:

```java
String[]items={"Shoes","Jacket","Gloves","AirPods","iPad","iPhone 12 case"};
double[]prices={99.99,150.0,9.99,250.0,439.50,39.99};
int[]itemIDs={12345,12346,12347,12348,12349,12350};
```

- find out the first index number of "Gloves"
- find out if "iPad" is contained in the item list
- Print the report of each shopping item `name` - `price` - `#ID`

6. Given the following arrays:

```java
String[]names={"Anna","Nancy","Sarah"};
int[]scores={90,75,80};
char[]grades=new char[names.length];
```

- write a program that can store the grades of the students in the array named grades
- print the grade report of each student in separate lines.

Example:

```
Anna's score is 90, and grade is A
```

7. write a program that can move all the zeros to the end of the array

Example:

```text
input:
array = {10, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0};

output:
{10, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0}
```

8. Write a program that can print out the common elements from two integer array

Example:

```text
input:
arr1: {1,2,3,4,5} 
arr2: {4,5,6,7,8}

output:
4 5
```

9. AverageNumber:
  1. Ask the user how many numbers user want to enter
  2. get all the inputs from the user and store them into an array
  3. Iterate the array & return the average number


10. Write a program that can merge 3 arrays of integers

Example:

```text
Input:
arr1 = {30, 10, 20}; 
arr2 = {15, 40, 25, 35}; 
arr3 = {8, 9, 17, 5, 4, 1} 

Output:
{30,10,20,15,40,25,35,8,9,17,5,4,1}
```

11. Write a program that can return the number of appearances of “java” and “python” anywhere in the
    sentence.
    _(similar to the task in repl.it, but this time you MUST use arrays and for each loop)_

12. Write a program to check if two string are Anagram

```text
checkAnagram("acdb","dbca") -> true
checkAnagram("room", "doom") -> false
```

13. write a program that can merge two arrays of integers

Example:

```text
input:
arr1 = {1,2,3,4} 
arr2 = {5,6}

output:
arr3 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
```

14. Write a program that will find out the shortest words in the given string str. If there are few
    words that are evenly short, print them all. Use the split method in order to split the str
    string variable and create an array of strings. Print array with `Arrays.toString()` method. Sort
    array before printing.

Example:

```text
input: 
olive, fish, pursuit, old, warning, python, java, coffee, cat, ray 

output: 
cat, old, ray
```

15. Write a program that can reverse a two dimensional array (return new array)

Example:

```text
input:
array = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6,7}, {8,9,10,11,12,13}};

output:
reverse = {{13,12,11,10,9,8}, {7,6,5,4}, {3,2,1},};
```

16. Given the Array:

```java
String[][]items={
    {"Apple","Banana","Grape","Avocado"},
    {"Paper Towels","Toilet Papers","Tissues","Diapers"},
    {"Coke","Fanta","Arizona Tea","Pepsi","Water"}
  };
```

- print the following output: (add `\t` between two words)

```text
Apple           Banana          Grape           Avocado
Paper Towels    Toilet Papers   Tissues         Diapers
Coke            Fanta           Arizona Tea     Pepsi           Water
```

- print the following output: (add `\t` between two words)

```text
Avocado         Grape           Banana          Apple
Diapers         Tissues         Toilet Papers   Paper Towels
Water           Pepsi           Arizona Tea     Fanta           Coke
```

- print the following output: (add `\t` between two words)

```text
Coke            Fanta           Arizona Tea     Pepsi           Water
Paper Towels    Toilet Papers   Tissues         Diapers
Apple           Banana          Grape           Avocado
```

17. Write a program that can reverse the word of every second word of the sentence

Example:

```text
input:
"I love Java so much more than Javascript"

output:
"I evol Java os much erom than tpircsavaJ"
```

```text
input:
"find all the palindrome string"

output:
"find lla the emordnilap string"
```

18. Write a program to add random 100 number to an integer array

- how many even numbers in the array?
- how many odd numbers in the array?
- how many numbers can be evenly divisible by 3?
- how many numbers can be evenly divisible by 5?

19. Given name array. find all the palindrome string then put into a new array.

```text
input:
{"Anna", "Nalan", "Hannah", "Emma", "Aidai", "Ciris", "Yasin", "Bob", "Inna", "Eve"};

output:
{"Anna", "Nalan", "Hannah", "Emma", "Bob", "Eve"}
```
